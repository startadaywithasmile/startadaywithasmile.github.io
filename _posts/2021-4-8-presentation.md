#Artistic Creations
#Actor Design#

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/ipa picture/ep/1_Actor" %}

{% raw %}
```liquid
/take a photograph
/retain the mouth and some of the facial characteristics of the actor
/turn her into a Na'vi
/come to a 3D sculpture 
/scan them into computer used as a model
```
{% endraw %}

#Language#

Paul FROUMMER PhD

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/ipa picture/ep/2_Language" %}

{% raw %}
```liquid
/the actors master the Na'vi  speak in Na'vi
/write syllables and consonants for JAMES HURNER so that JAMES could use 
when his team were singing
```
{% endraw %}

#Music#

JAMES HURNER

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/ipa picture/ep/3_Music" %}

{% raw %}
```liquid
/collect sounds of different instruments around the world, ethnically based
/and then he worked with them electronically to make a difference with the real instrument 
so that it sounds like you haven't heard it before
```
{% endraw %}

"I was true to the Na'vi language" he said.

#Technology Research

#Camera#

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/ipa picture/ep/4_Camera" %}

`the virtual camera` `the reference camera`

{% raw %}
```liquid
the virtual camera shows us what the shot will look like with the CG characters and the world combined
-> the virtual camera is made for the director
the reference cameras are absolutely critical for getting exactly the moment that we want 
-> the animators (Weta) will check the reference footage to make sure that they're not making mistake during their processing
```

#Weta#

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/ipa picture/ep/5_Weta" %}

`eye` `facial muscles` `tails, ears` 

{% raw %}
```liquid
eye
-> Weta scanned them with their own software and toke 60 to 70 different poses of their eyes 
facial muscles
-> study the details using reference cameras to make sure the animation they made  looks the same as the performance
-> it takes months of months for the animator to create the facial muscles for each character
tails, ears
->add things like the tail, the ears and imagine how they move after studying cat and dog and other animals' behavior 
```
